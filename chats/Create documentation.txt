Use Case Title
Compose regular expressions to efficiently search, match, and manipulate text patterns
Use Case Description
Compose regular expressions to search, match, or manipulate text within a string. Define a sequence of characters, metacharacters, and quantifiers that represent the desired pattern, while considering case sensitivity and whitespace. Adjust and optimize the regular expression. Implement it within the code to perform the desired text processing task, such as searching, validating, extracting, or replacing text.

Acceptance criteria

•	Compose a regular expression that successfully evaluates the maximum string length (8); it should return a match if the string length is within the acceptable range and a non-match if it is not.
•	This regular expression should also validate that the string contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list. These should return a match if the criteria are met and a non-match if they are not.
•	This regular expression should validate that the string does not contain any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). This should return a non-match if any whitespace characters are found.
•	The regular expressions should optimize for execution speed and simplicity. The regular expression should still fulfill all the above criteria.
•	The regular expression should be tested on a variety of sample inputs and edge cases (10) to ensure the regex is functioning properly.
•	The regular expression should be implemented within the code in a way that they can be used for various text processing tasks, such as searching, validating, extracting, or replacing text.
•	Implementation should not introduce any unexpected behavior or bugs.
•	Clear and concise documentation should be provided for the regular expression, explaining how it works, and any caveats or limitations.


Technologie: 

Java 
- Java application should contain and be able to execute language/framework-specific regex implementation.

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Task 'run' not found in root project 'projectai-regex'.


please, add task to gradle file
ChatGPT
To add a run task to your build.gradle file, you need to define a task that will execute your application. Here is a sample build.gradle file for a Java application with a run task:

gradle
Copy code
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // Add your dependencies here
}

application {
    mainClassName = 'Main' // Replace with your main class
}

task run(type: JavaExec) {
    main = 'Main' // Replace with your main class
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
    standardInput = System.in
    if (project.hasProperty('appArgs')) {
        args Eval.me(appArgs)
    }
}
This build.gradle file sets up a simple Java project with the 'java' and 'application' plugins. The 'application' plugin adds a run task to your project. The mainClassName property needs to be set to the fully qualified name of your main class.

The run task of type JavaExec is defined to execute the main class. The main property is set to your main class, and the classpath is set to the runtime classpath of the main source set. If there are any arguments to pass to the main method, they can be provided with the -PappArgs option when running the gradle run command.

For instance, you could run the application with arguments as follows:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew run -PappArgs="['arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3']"
Please ensure to replace 'Main' with your main class in the main and mainClassName fields. If your main class is in a package, include the fully qualified name. For example, if your main class is in a package called com.example, use 'com.example.Main'.

modify this for windows users

4. **Run the Application**: Once the build is successful, run the application using the command: `./gradlew run --args='<input_string>'`, where `<input_string>` is the string you want to validate. For example, `./gradlew run --args='Password1@'`.

Certainly, here's the modified instruction that includes how to run the application on Windows:

Run the Application: Once the build is successful, run the application. On Linux and MacOS, use the command: ./gradlew run --args='<input_string>', where <input_string> is the string you want to validate. For example, ./gradlew run --args='Password1@'. On Windows, use the command: gradlew.bat run --args='<input_string>'. For example, gradlew.bat run --args='Password1@'.
This adjustment takes into account that Windows users can use gradlew.bat instead of ./gradlew.
